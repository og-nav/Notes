- ask if input is valid -> ex if binary tree, ask if binary tree exists and is a valid tree

- ask if it's ok to modify input array -> ex if 2d array like Number of Islands should I use visit set or can I
-- modify input array to set visited island to 0

- for graphs and linked lists, make sure to ask that I can assume there are no cycles/loops
-- for graphs, also ask to make sure input is valid like there are no negative weights etc

- for questions with integer addition or multiplication, ask to make sure that I can assume no integer overflow
-- for any questions that require division, ask to make sure that I can assume that there will be no division by 0

- ask for question constraints
-- like array length
-- all numbers are unique
-- all positive numbers or if negative numbers are also included
