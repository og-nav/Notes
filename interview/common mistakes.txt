1. need to remember that the second arguments in python are often non-inclusive
  - so for example, if you are using a for loop to do sliding window, you need to remember that the second argument
    of range and the second argument of the slice are non-inclusive, so you need to do + 1 for one of them. otherwise
    you will cut out the last element
    ex:
    for i in range(len(prefix), len(s) + 1):
      if s[i - len(prefix): i] == prefix:
        continue # some action

2. when using "".join(nums), all elements in the array must be strings
  - ex: nums = [1, 2, 3] -> res = "".join(nums) -> WRONG
        nums = ['1', '2', '3'] -> res = "".join(nums) -> RIGHT
